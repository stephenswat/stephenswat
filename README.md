### Hello!

Hi there! My name is Stephen, and I'm a high-performance scientific software
engineer at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN).
Specifically, I work on @acts-project, where I am trying to bring
GPGPU technology to track reconstruction.

Besides high performance computing, I am also enamoured with programing
language theory, functional programming, and compilers. I enjoy learning more
about category theory and logic, but I don't have much time to study them. My
favourite programming languages are Python, C++, Rust, and Haskell. One of the
things I enjoy most in my line of work is education, and I am always looking
for ways to help out with trainings and such!

Outside of computing, I am an amateur photographer and I really enjoy tabletop
roleplaying games. I like to ride my bicycle around the Swiss-French
countryside for exercise.

Please feel free to contact me with questions, suggestions, collaborations, or
whatever else!
